# Reconstruction status labels

- `identified`: the address and broad purpose are known.
- `analyzed`: control flow and important side effects are understood.
- `partial`: some corresponding portable behavior is implemented, but it is
  not complete enough for a fidelity claim.
- `implemented`: the portable behavior is complete enough for focused tests.
- `verified`: behavior has passed an original-versus-reconstruction test with
  representative retail data or event sequences.

Addresses describe the retail executable only. The portable executable does
not try to preserve internal addresses, compiler-generated class layouts, or
operating-system handles.

## Current portable slices

The first game-core slice covers:

- the constructor defaults used when `SFlare.Cfg` is absent
- the exact 16-value, 64-byte config load/save layout
- retail validation, clamping, and partial updates on failed reads
- Shift-JIS-aware `/w` and `/f` command-line handling
- the title, character-selection, and gameplay transition dispatcher
- the title enter/leave lifecycle and its exact resource manifest
- the title fade, menu navigation, hover regions, delayed actions, audio cues,
  smoke-animation scheduling, CAF decoding, and steam drawing
- portable V001/V003 VOC decoding and LAL playback for title and menu audio
- new-character and saved-game selection enter/leave behavior
- the character-selection fade and top-level per-frame screen dispatcher
- saved-game list navigation, slot hit regions, double-click timing, and the
  Continue, Delete, Back, and Exit decisions
- new-character gender selection and portable 15-byte name entry
- Online/Single and New/Join mode menus plus portable host-address entry
- saved-game summary parsing, BMP previews, and Delete confirmation
- software drawing with the original Select and bitmap-font pattern sheets
- the six-slot save-name search used by both menu states
- both retail menu input-binding tables
- the statically linked Visual C++ random-number generator
- gameplay entry and its retail loading-screen sub-state
- portable RCLIB-L decoding shared by NJP and ground-map data
- the initial `00000000` scenario's fixed MCT header and entry-point table
- its leading ID lists, common variable entity record, and seven-record
  `PEOPLE` block
- its data-selected ground and object maps, NJP/SDW pattern list, new-player
  spawn, facing direction, title, music, and player CAF/NJP/SDW drawing
- Ostare's retail people resource, placement, part mask, shadow, idle pause,
  and bounded walk

These pieces live in `OpenShadowFlare::GameCore` and have no dependency on
LWL, LGL, LAL, Win32, or another platform API. The executable runtime loads
the config before creating its LWL window, just as the retail entry point does.

Portable behavior originating in the DLLs is kept under `SF_EXE/libs`, with a
directory for each of the fourteen original boundaries. `RK_FUNCTION`,
`RKC_DBFCONTROL`, `RKC_DIB`, `RKC_DSOUND`, `RKC_UPDIB`, and `RKC_RPGSCRN`
currently build as separate static libraries. Each has one public API header
and small implementation files; future executable slices should port proven
behavior from the corresponding Win32 reconstruction into the matching
library instead of adding it directly to `GameCore`.

The menu lifecycle code emits resource, input, cursor, and audio work through
portable callbacks. Those callbacks deliberately describe what the game needs,
not how a particular operating system provides it.

The title screen's game decisions from `0x00420e60` are now reconstructed.
Its original background, menu entries, selection brightness, and fades are
drawn by the portable runtime. All ten smoke animations use their original CAF
frames, random delays, pipe positions, and scene brightness. Version/copyright
text and network messages are the remaining title presentation work. The
runtime also loads the retail common-effects and title-music VOC containers,
plays voice 62 for the title cue, voice 58 for navigation, voice 56 for title
confirmation, and starts the looping BGM after the original 60-frame delay.

The top-level character-selection dispatcher at `0x00421c50` is reconstructed
through its fade, mode dispatch, sub-screen dispatch, and delayed gameplay
transition. New-character creation, the saved-game list, Delete confirmation,
and all shared mode/host screens are implemented and drawn with the original
assets. LWL supplies portable UTF-8 text and clipboard input; the game state
keeps the retail 15-byte field limit and does not depend on a native edit
control. Selecting a new character now follows the executable's exact
20-frame, 97-pixel center slide while the opposite portrait fades. The reverse
animation, 130-by-20 name field, and 6-by-12 block caret mirror the retail draw
packets as well. Shared mode dialogs are drawn as full-bright overlays after
their dimmed backdrop, and returning from the saved-game dialog restores both
the list brightness and its interaction state. Save-slot numerals now remain
static unless pointed at; only the hovered numeral follows the retail
3-2-1-0-0-1-2-3 pulse.

Character selection keeps the title BGM playing when it is already active,
starts it on entry when necessary, uses common voice 55 for its selection
actions, and releases the music when the menu flow ends. All playback uses the
retail effect and BGM volume values through LAL.

Gameplay entry at `0x0041d3f0` now prepares the initial single-player world.
The initial loading presentation follows the cached `Waiting.njp` path in
`0x00402920`: pattern 0 is the Episode 1 background, pattern 3 is the
bottom-right loading label, and pattern 2 becomes the horizontally moving
confirmation arrow after world setup completes. Return or a click inside the
retail arrow rectangle enters the world. The 120-frame `VisualNN.njp` fade in
`0x00417bd0` is a separate loading presenter used later in gameplay and is not
part of this initial transition.

`ScenarioData` follows the fixed part of `0x00427b50`: it validates
`MCED DATA v0000\x1a`, reads the two 260-byte paths, music index, and 256-byte
area title, then decodes the trailing 16-byte entry records in their file order
of key, world X, world Y, and direction. At `0x324`, the first three counted ID
lists lead into a shared variable entity record. The portable slice skips the
understood-size object tail and decodes the following `PEOPLE` records,
including variable names and custom part/color arrays. Later entity groups
remain opaque. For scenario `00000000`, entry key zero supplies
(`89898`, `2811`, direction `3`) and the MCT map path selects `f00_01`.

The first scenario then draws the decoded `f00_01.Gnd` cells at that entry and
places the selected male or female animation at the camera center. Its 279
`f00_01.Obl` records now supply
Remote Town's gates, walls, trees, rocks, and other static scenery. Pattern
bounds provide view culling, the OBL status classes and judgement rectangles
provide retail depth keys, and the player is inserted into the default scenery
pass at foot depth. Paired `ShadowLowPat` SDW assets render first with the
configured opaque or 50-percent shadow mode through GAPI's general opacity
support.

The first decoded person is Ostare: local ID `0`, people resource `13`, name
color `0x00e0e0e0`, position (`91467`, `1532`), judgement
`[-80, -80, 79, 79]`, and direction `7`. The custom 256-entry part table leaves
CAF parts 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 enabled while disabling 4 and 5. Portable loading
resolves that resource to `Character/PEOPLE/00000013`, loads its NJP, SDW, and
CAF, and runs it at the 30 Hz game cadence. The people tail supplies speed 10,
a 30-update walk limit, a 30-update idle pause, and a spawn-relative rectangle
from (`-437`, `-223`) to (`269`, `231`). The type-one update at `0x0045d150`
starts movement after that pause; movement-controller mode three chooses an
inclusive random point in the rectangle, and `0x0045d9f0` selects CAF chart
one until arrival or the walk limit. The first tested draw uses shadow pattern
280 and visible patterns 1744 and 1784 at the retail starting camera anchor.
Actor shadows and visible cells share the depth-sorted world passes with the
player and static OBL scenery.

The player CAF path now follows `0x00434ef0` and the appearance refresh at
`0x00444ca0`: the MCT direction is preserved, and the per-part enable table
starts with only the base body and shadow. Equipment layers remain disabled
until the future inventory slice has an equipped item to select them. The
player shadow comes from
`Animation00.Sdw`; palette index zero remains the NJP cutout rather than being
drawn as a black pixel.

The initial scenario's MCT music field is `0`. The transition helper at
`0x004275e0` maps that to `System\Game\Music\BGM00.Voc`, and the update helper
at `0x004275a0` starts sample zero looping in voice slot 500. Gameplay now
starts the same track once the world is prepared, applies the configured BGM
volume through LAL, and releases it with the gameplay state.

The first interactive world loop follows the retail movement path through
`0x00441c00`, `0x00454210`, `0x00454930`, `0x004351f0`, and `0x00434ef0`.
LWL button state becomes a 640-by-480 ground command, the RKC_RPGSCRN inverse
projection turns it into a world destination, and the unequipped new player
gets speed tier five. `0x00450080` indexes the retail factor table, multiplies
its `1.0` result by the base speed `20.0`, and stores a 20-unit walk step plus
the doubled 40-unit run step. Retail's DBF thread advances movement roughly
every 33 ms. The portable shell now uses an elapsed-time accumulator to update
all game state at the same 30 Hz cadence while continuing to present at 60 Hz.
This keeps movement and CAF frame counters on one clock and preserves their
real-time speeds. Held input replaces the destination without restarting the
current movement action.

Walk is executable action 2 and CAF chart 1 at `0x004351f0`; run is action 3
and CAF chart 2 at `0x00435530`. The `R` binding now toggles the persistent
movement mode on its key-down edge. Switching while already moving resets the
animation counter and immediately changes both the chart and the movement
step, as the retail action transition does.

GND loading now includes the second, 852-by-852 Remote Town judgement plane.
The portable RKC_RPGSCRN boundary checks its bit-zero blockers and the
status-one OBL judgement rectangles against the retail player box
`[-80, -80, 79, 79]`. The movement controller performs integer swept checks,
keeps the last walkable point, and tries the two axis slides when a diagonal
step meets scenery. The renderer reads chart zero for idle and chart one for
walking directly from player state, rebuilds the depth key from the moving
position, and follows the player's projected position with the retail camera
offset.

This is still not complete gameplay. The other people records, AI, dynamic
actor collision, interaction, the HUD, scripts, darkness, equipment state, and
saved-game scenario restoration are the next executable layers.
