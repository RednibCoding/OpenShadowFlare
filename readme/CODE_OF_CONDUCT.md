## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In our commitment to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, vow to ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone participating in our project and community. This commitment stands regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

#### Positive behaviors contributing to a constructive environment include:

- Employing a language that is welcoming and inclusive.
- Showing respect for varying perspectives and experiences.
- Graciously receiving constructive feedback.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community.
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other members.

#### Behaviors deemed unacceptable include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, and giving unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Engaging in trolling, insult-driven comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Harassment, be it public or private.
- Releasing private information of others, such as physical or digital addresses, without clear consent.
- Any other actions that are professionally considered inappropriate.

### Our Responsibilities

Maintainers of the project hold the responsibility to clarify what is acceptable behavior and are anticipated to implement appropriate corrective measures in response to any instances of misconduct.

Maintainers reserve the right to edit, reject, or remove comments, commits, code, wiki edits, and issues that don't align with this Code of Conduct. They can also ban any contributor temporarily or permanently for behaviors they find inappropriate, harmful, offensive, or threatening.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct is applicable both within project areas and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

### Enforcement

Abusive, harassing, or any other kind of unacceptable behavior can be reported by getting in touch with the project team. All reports will be assessed and investigated, leading to a response that's deemed appropriate. It's imperative for the project team to ensure the reporter's confidentiality.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4.
